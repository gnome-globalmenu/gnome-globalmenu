INTRODUCTION
============

gtk+-aqd is inspired from the patch originally written by AqD, posted at ubuntu forum.
The original purpose for writing this patch is to give gtk applications a Mac-like menu bar.

Since the Gnome GlobalMenu project is started, we picked up AqD's idea and explained the
purpose of our work as providing a global menu for gnome applications.

HOW DOES IT WORK
================

After several major changes in the framework, we ended up with very little modifications in GTK.
The patch only does 1 thing:
	1) invoke gtk_legacy_menu_new when gtk_menu_bar_new is invoked.
